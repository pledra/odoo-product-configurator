**What is the Product Configurator?**
=====================================

The Product Configurator is a versatile tool that is addressed to businesses around the world that want to offer custom made products.

Combining the simple use of Odoo with the Product Configurator we managed to achive a powerful tool that manages to adapt to every business type.

.. Visual customization is one of the key points of our product. A modular approach using themes and building blocks ensures a visual display of the product you configure.

Furthermore the Product Configurator comes with a series of standard views, themes and everything is easily extensible to give full freedom to the user.

Setting up your product configuration requires no technical knowledge. With just a few clicks your customers have access to a simple user interface that automatically guides them through the full process of customization.

.. This means you can quickly build your configuration process. No costly customization or a line of code is required.

Saving time is also one of the key aspects of the Product Configurator. Every time you process a request from a customer via e-mail or phone, you lose precious time.

We believe that any configuration process, no matter how complex, should not require manual intervention or costly and time-consuming customization. All you should have to do is process the final order and make better use of the time saved.
